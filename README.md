# Simple Crypt Library
This library is specifically designed to explain the XOR fundamentals of encryption. It is NOT for legitimate/production use.This project is for learning purposes for those who do not understand how XOR can encrypt data. If you wish to cipher your information for learning purposes, this simple library/executable is for you.









Here is a link to the compiler that I typically use for my projects.

This is the compiler I used:
x86_64-7.3.0-release-posix-seh-rt_v5-rev0.7z
